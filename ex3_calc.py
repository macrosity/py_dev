# This script will do some basic calculations in Python.

print "If I have 222 batteries and 17 remote controls, and each remote control takes 4 batteries, how many batteries will remain?"
print "Total batteries needed to fill all remote controls:", 17 * 4

print "Number of batteries remaining will be:", 222 - 17 * 4

# Now that we understand how mathematics works a little better in programming languages, we can write about it here.
# The order in which notation can be best referred to is PEMDAS
# 
# Parenthesis
# Exponents
# Multiplication
# Division
# Addition
# Subtraction
#
# So 8 + 5 * 3 = 22, not 39, as multiplication takes prescience over addition, but (8 + 5) * 3 = 39, not 22 because parenthesis takes prescience
# over multiplication as we can see above.
